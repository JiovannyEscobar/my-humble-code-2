## COMMENTS ON PATCH NOTES VER 4 (PYAUDIO VERSION)
Great work my friend.

1. Let's not do VAD
2. It's fine if it is not accurate, so no need to combine (let's see first how inaccurate actually)
3. Let's not do subtitling function (for now)
4. Let's not do voice commands (Unless you like). Have a button to stop start and stop stuff.

If you have any more questions or need further assistance with anything, feel free to ask. 
Happy coding!

 
## DEPENDENCIES
You must have Whisper AI working first.
